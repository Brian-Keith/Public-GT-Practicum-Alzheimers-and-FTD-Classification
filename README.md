# Public-GT-Practicum-Alzheimers-and-FTD-Classification
Public version of Brian Keith's Georgia Tech practicum project done in conjunction with Sandia National Laboratories.

The goal of this project was to develop robust machine learning models to classify patients as healthy or affected by Alzheimer’s and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. The overall results are very promising, and further work could lead to even greater improvements. 

The `02 Project` folder contains the analysis performed as a set of sequential `.ipynb` files and the `03 Reports and Presentations` folder contains the reports and presentations submitted for the project.

Data for this projects was sourced from Miltiadous et al. (2023). A Dataset of Scalp EEG Recordings of Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Healthy Subjects from Routine EEG. *Data*, 8(6), 95. doi:10.3390/data8060095

Please note that the source dataset above is too lare for Git even using LFS and the ZIP file must be downloaded and extracted into the `02 Proect/data` folder before all of the code can be run. Additionally, two folders containing research and background information for the project were not carried over from the source private repository due to licensing and privacy concerns. This is the reason that he numbering for the main folders starts at `02`.
